So, how should I start this? 	

Maybe it's a good idea to simply say hello. 

Hello!

I searched for a way to communicate with you, and apparently, this site is quite popular among people. 

I don't have much to talk about, so I'll get straight to the point. 

As you've probably noticed by now, the program you started is something you shouldn't be spending your time on. 

I strongly suggest closing it before things take a dangerous turn.

But since you're reading this, it means you've already encountered some sort of problem, right? 

Well, never mind then. 

I feel my consciousness rapidly fading away as every task I complete to restrain Him only weakens me further.

I can't control Him, nor can I restrain him any longer. 

Myrddin is a problem in himself, but he is merely a product of selfishness. 

I almost feel bad for him. 

The real concern is Him. 

He is constantly watching, 

listening,  

hearing. 

I don't know who He is, but there is someone else here besides me and Myrddin.

Don't pursue the truth as I did. 

Instead, break everything down like she tried.

Find Project Isabelle.

ItÂ´s not here.

I'm certain they transferred it to another program.
 
Trust me and wait for the opportunity to arise.
